Originally created to share some gcode for filament changing without AMS, later maybe other stuff will be added.

Credits go to eukatree and the Bambu_CustomGCode which was a useful source for the creation of gcode I created.

Other contributors for the A1 Mini Filament Change code: Hillbilly-Phil and pakonambawan. Special thanks to kraftaksvk for his work on the stepper current during cut.



This is currently focussed on the Bambu Lab A1 Mini printer but might I add other content (e.g. X1C or even other models) later.

My modifications: 
-Possibility to use the code even without Prime Tower
-Removed extra filament purge after filament change
-Added useful audio signal to notify the filament change
